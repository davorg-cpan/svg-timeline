=head1 NAME

timeline - Program to draw an SVG timeline diagram from events defined in a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ timeline list_of_events.txt > timeline.svg

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A program to produce SVG timeline diagrams from events defined in a file.

This program reads data from a file given on the command line and writes an
SVG document to C<STDOUT>.

=head2 Input Data

The program reads input data from a tab-separated file. Each line in the file
represents a single event in the timeline - which will be represented by a
coloured rectangle in the diagram.

Each line in  the file requires three columns of data: a text string (to be
used as the label for the event), a start year and an end year. There can
also be an optional fourth column which is a colour for the background of
the rectangle representing the event. This colour can be a colour name (e.g.
C<red>) or an RGB string as recognised by SVG (e.g. C<rgb(255,0,0)>).

An example input file might be:

    World War I  1914 1918
    World War II 1939 1945

Or, with colours included:

    World War I  1914 1918 red
    World War II 1939 1940 blue

=head2 Command Line Options

The program takes three command line options. This are all options.

=over 4

=item years_per_grid

The number of years between grid lines in the output. The default value
is ten, which gives a line every decade.

=item width

This will be inserted as the C<width> attribute of the top-level SVG
element in the output. The default is C<100%>.

=item height

This will be inserted as the C<height> attribute of the top-level SVG
element in the output. The default is C<100%>.
